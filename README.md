# Recipeace

A handy thing designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and a monitor in your kitchen. Send a link to it and it'll show you a trimmed down version of your recipe. Just ingredients and instructions hopefully. No more horrid mess of ads and self-indulgent blog post. Also maybe there's a handy scrolling mechanism.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
